Fuck you and your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

I was into you, but I'm over it now
And I was tryin' to be nice
But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out
